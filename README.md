### Problem Statment
The retail company is experiencing stagnant growth and declining customer engagement due to inconsistent product performance, ineffective customer segmentation, and limited insights into purchasing behavior. The goal is to address these issues by analyzing sales, customer data, and inventory to improve decision-making.

### Project Overview
This case study analyzes a retail company's data to optimize product performance, segment customers, and enhance marketing and inventory strategies. It tackles challenges like stagnant growth and poor engagement by leveraging SQL-based analysis to derive actionable insights.

### Tools Used
- MySQL: For querying and analyzing the dataset.
- GitHub: For storing and showcasing the project.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
Data was cleaned by removing duplicates, replacing nulls with "Unknown", correcting price discrepancies, and standardizing date formats. Refer to SQL Queries for details (e.g., Q1-Q4).

### Exploratory Data Analysis
This phase explores the dataset to uncover initial insights. Key questions to check include:
1. What are the total sales and quantities per product? (Q5)
2. How frequently do customers transact? (Q6)
3. What are the sales trends over time? (Q10)
4. How do product categories perform in terms of sales? (Q7) Refer to SQL Queries for the queries.

### Data Analysis
This phase dives deeper into business insights. Key questions to check include:

1. Which are the top 10 high-revenue products? (Q8)
2. Which products have the least units sold? (Q9)
3. What is the month-on-month sales growth rate? (Q11)
4. Who are the high-frequency and occasional customers? (Q12, Q13)
5. Which customers repeat purchases per product? (Q14)
6. How long is the duration between a customerâ€™s first and last purchase? (Q15)
7. How are customers segmented by purchase quantity? (Q16) Refer to SQL Queries for the queries.

### Results/Findings
- Cleaned data resolved inconsistencies (Q1-Q4).
- Identified top-performing and low-selling products (Q5, Q8, Q9).
- Segmented customers into Low, Medium, and High value groups (Q16).
- Analyzed sales trends and customer loyalty metrics (Q10, Q11, Q15).

### Recommendations
- Target marketing toward high-performing products and High value segments.
- Reduce inventory of low-selling items.
- Develop retention strategies for loyal customers based on purchase duration.
- Visualize results with Python or BI tools for better insights.

### Limitations
- Analysis is limited to the provided dataset, potentially missing broader trends.
- Lacks advanced statistical or predictive modeling.
- No external data (e.g., market trends) was integrated.
